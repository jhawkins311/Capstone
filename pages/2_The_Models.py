Welcome to **Chapter 2: Models** of the Synthetic Data 101 course!

In this chapter, you'll explore four foundational models from the [Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)](https://docs.sdv.dev/) library.

**Synthesizers** are tools that use machine learning algorithms that:
1) Learn the patterns and characteristics from real datasets
3) Ceate new synthetic data that maintains the same statistical relationships and format as the original, while being entirely artificial. 

The Synthetic Data Vault (SDDV) offers a range of synthesizers. Each mdoel is designed with own strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases.

### 🧰 A Quick Quick to Different SDV Synthesizers:

| Model              | Type of Data           | Strengths                                           | Limitations                    | Speed                   |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **CTGAN**          | Numerical, Categorical | High quality on complex, imbalanced data            | Requires tuning                | ⏳ Slow                 |
| **TVAE**           | Numerical, Categorical | Captures non-linear patterns well                   | Higher resource demand          | ⚖️ Medium              |
| **GaussianCopula** | Mostly Numerical       | Fast, easy to use                                   | Struggles with complex/mixed data | ⚡ Fast             |
| **CopulaGAN**      | Numerical, Categorical | Combines GANs with statistical copulas for balance  | Newer model, fewer benchmarks   | ⚡ Fast                 |

The **CTGAN Synthesizer** uses a GAN-based approach where a generator and discriminator compete to improve output quality.  
It’s particularly effective on **imbalanced** and **mixed-type** datasets (e.g., medical or credit data).  
CTGAN can take longer to train but often produces high-fidelity results that preserve deep feature relationships.
